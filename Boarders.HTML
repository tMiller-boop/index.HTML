    and it still served a good roll in it-->
    <title > Don't Press The Button! </title>
</head><!--background stayed the same since it was a copy of the original HTML file. same with color choice of the text-->

    <!--the why did you click the button when i was able to get it to work had me rolling-->
    <h1 style="color: rgb(239, 255, 17);"> <br/> Why did you press the button!</h1>
    <br/>
    <br/><!-- the website i went to was pngimg.com it had a good variaty of images that I liked. always go for the roylalty free
    be sure to inspect your with left click so you can check your size of the image, the measurements go off 
    the lower number for smaller images, such as at 100%  it took up the screen, thats why its at only 25%-->

        <!--at this point i was just messing around trying to figure out what other styles I can add to it and not even sure any of them took-->
    <h2 style="color: rgb(239, 255, 17);"> <button onclick="" style="font-style: inherit;" style="animation: ease-in-out;" > BUTTON </button>
        WHY!!<br/><!--i was having issues focusing in on it to read the degree objectives, so I see it if im having issues reading it others will too
        so they can either accept the better more bold print that I supply or suffer reading the small print -->
         Here is some information on game programming; focusing on the degree objectives are as follows; Implement multiple completed games,<br/>
          including 3D games, using common tools, languages and software for web, console, PC or mobile platforms.<br/>
        Design, develop and implement the architecture and ifreastructure needed to support a complete game project.<br/>
        Implement and analyze fundamental data structures and algorithms assosiated with game aplications supporting <br/>
        gameplay mechanics.<br/>
        Using the software development processes to analyze a project problem and to design, build and test a corresponding software solution<br/>
        Demonstrate development skills using multiple programming languages, development enviroments and platforms, including advanced<br/>
        and/or experimental topics in game programming.<br/>
        Establish collaboration, mintorship and professional leadaership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly polished<br/>
        and completed projects.<br/>
        "god are my fingers hurt already" so thats the degree objectives, I made sure to type it up so it would be easier to read instead of 
        clicking the image and zooming in just to read the fine print.<br/>
        
    </h2></a><!-- the actual assignment as it says copy and paste the program objectives for your major(didn't know my major) into the boartds.html page
    followed the catalog links. asked my teacher for assistance as well as student services for assistance  -->
