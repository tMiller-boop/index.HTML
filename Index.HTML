    <br/><!--the easiest discription to demonstrate both the large and small effects you can do with programing code
    the easiest way that i could discribe it was threw a movie that uses alot of CGI (computer-generated imagery) 
    other ways of detailing every aspect to someone that knows next to nothing about it may overwhelm the reader 
    and cause them to loose interest escpecially someone like a younger me. simple, clear, easy to follow. keep 
    the complex stuff to the comment -->
    <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);" style="font-size: x-large;">Game Programming is something that has always had my interest, being able<br/>
         to make whole worlds out of code sounds amazing "right!" think of some of the coolest movies with distruction "Godzilla Vs Kong" for example; <br/>
        remember their fights where their smashing threw buildings, you see debris flying everywhere, well that's part of code! <br/>
        scailing for & the Giant Kaiju themselves in the movie also start from code like this in the image. I'm not as knowledgeable <br/>
        about the whole in's & out's of the full process ("right know") but for what I am knowledgeable of will be placed in the site <br/>
        in an easy to understand way for both yoursake & mine. 
    </h3><br/><!--thought i'd give a little comparison with humor, providing a relatable backstory and thought adding in my original to save time. it was
    a funny meme of cool jesus saying dont hit the button with the link going to a image of an explosion saying why did you hit the button. didnt wanna delete
    it so I incorperated it instead. there will be another link to a simular coded webpage with to rest of the assignment that goes with this one.-->
    <h4 style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);" style="font-size: x-large;"> I know theres alot of times where your thinking "why am I here? what am I doing?" Fair question to ask right? Those types of questions<br/>
        should be more focused on what can you do later (with the knowledge you aquired at the school) sure college can be boring but its what you<br/>
        spend your time doing at the school that really matters. for me? I'm no major success story, I didnt pay much attention in class growing up<br/>
        I still graduated so I thought that was enough. turns out after 13 years I finally got a joy for learning programming. I've put all my time<br/>
        between work and sleep I'm learning code, schooling. sometimes I just wanna "HIT THAT BUTTON" and end it all but I dont. also "Don't Hit The Button!"</h4>

            <!--having fun with the button seeing what I can make it do if anything special will happen. downloaded button image png for it but decited not to
